Requirements:
  `go get github.com/marcusolsson/tui-go`


1. Navigate to pkg/server/cmd and start the server with `go run main.go`

2. Navigate to cmd/ and start the client with `go run main.go`

Repeat step 2 to add another client. Exit client with `ctrl+c` or `ESC` 


Clients names aren't currently displayed. I'm using autogenerated PublicKey to differentiate each client.Using custom protocol. I only have tests for the protocol.
Closing the server before closing all of the clients is not handled currently and may result in an unexpected error.


I used https://github.com/marcusolsson/tui-go for displaying messages and server.

The whole process took me about 4 hours, I finished the task in one day (22.03.2021).
